## Quaternius Universal Animation Library [Pro] — CC0 1.0 Universal

- `assets/animation-library.glb` — the bundled 12-clip core, cut from the
  **Universal Animation Library [Pro]** by **Quaternius** (quaternius.com):
  120 humanoid animation clips on a UE-mannequin-style skeleton.
- `public/assets/anims/*.glb` — additional per-clip cuts from the same
  library, installed on demand by `npx genex controller anims`.

Dedicated to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal
license (SPDX: `CC0-1.0`). No attribution is required by the license; this
notice is provided as a courtesy — supporting Quaternius on Patreon is a nice
way to say thanks.

## Fallback avatar — CC0 1.0 Universal

The player's body is the game's own generated character; a VRM avatar is the
fallback lane. `genex controller character` copies the bundled default
`assets/default-avatar.vrm` to `public/assets/avatar.vrm`, which covers local
dev and load failures when that lane runs. It is **Wizzir** from the
**100 Avatars** project by
**Polygonal Mind** (polygonalmind.com), dedicated to the public domain under
CC0 1.0 Universal (SPDX: `CC0-1.0`). Attribution is a courtesy, not required.

## @pixiv/three-vrm — MIT License

The VRM support in `character/vrm/` (loader, animation retargeter, foot IK) is
built on the **@pixiv/three-vrm** npm package, MIT-licensed by pixiv Inc.
`vrm-retarget.ts` adapts that package's official humanoid-retarget example (MIT)
to the Quaternius rig. Install it into your game with `npm i @pixiv/three-vrm`.

## Basis Universal transcoder (`assets/basis_transcoder.js`, `assets/basis_transcoder.wasm`)

Copyright 2019-2024 Binomial LLC — Licensed under the Apache License, Version
2.0. Vendored from the three.js distribution (examples/jsm/libs/basis) so the
quality kit's KTX2Loader can transcode GPU-compressed `.ktx2` textures; served

contract. You may obtain a copy of the License at
