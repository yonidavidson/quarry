// src/genex.config.ts — written by `genex init`. DO NOT hardcode URLs here.
//
// Build once, run anywhere. The games host injects the serving environment into
// window.__GENEX__ (a small inline script in the no-cache page, ahead of this
// bundle), so ONE build is correct on every stand — promoting a game is a copy,
// never a rebuild, and an immutable bundle can never pin the wrong environment.
// Vite env still overrides, but is loaded ONLY by `npm run dev`:
//   .env                    -> VITE_GENEX_SLUG (local override for `npm run dev`)
//   .env.development.local  -> local-stack URL overrides (dev mode ONLY; gitignored)
//
// The slug is ALSO baked as a literal below, on purpose: `genex preview/publish`
// excludes .env from the source push (it's treated as a secret file), so a clone of
// the published repo has no .env. Reading the slug from env ALONE would then build
// `slug: undefined` -> the guest-session call posts {} -> 400 -> guests can't play a
// remixed game. The literal keeps a bare clone rebuilding into a working game; the
// env var still wins locally.
