## Camera contract

Record before implementation:

```ts
type CameraDirectionContract = {
  subject: THREE.Object3D
  subjectScale: number
  projection: { fov: number; near: number; far: number }
  positionMode: "authored" | "mount" | "body-relative" | "floating-origin"
  upMode: "world" | "subject" | "dominant-body"
  inputMode: "locked" | "pointer-look" | "orbit-offset"
  handoffOwner: string
  spatialConstraints: string[]
}
```

Do not combine modes until each can produce a valid position and quaternion
independently.

## planet-space implementation ship-scaled chase mount

`CameraRigSystem` derives the chase mount from ship length:

```text
height = shipLength * 0.5
back = shipLength * 1.3
mount position = (0, height, -back)

look target:
  up = shipLength * 0.0001
  forward = shipLength * 0.35
```

It constructs a basis:

```text
forward = normalize(target - mount)
right = normalize(cross(worldUp, forward))
up = normalize(cross(forward, right))
quaternion = quaternion(makeBasis(right, up, forward))
quaternion *= rotation(worldUp, π)
```

The final `π` correction is model-convention specific. Verify the camera’s
local forward convention before retaining it.

The mount is parented to `ShipRoot`, so its world position/quaternion follows
the ship without recomputing the authored chase pose.

## planet-space implementation thrust-lag spring

planet-space implementation adds camera distance behind the ship only while manual thrust is
active. Throttle and boost own separate scalar spring states:

```text
throttle max = 3.8
boost max = 5.8
combined max = 8.2

drive acceleration:
  throttle 12
  boost 22.8

held stiffness:
  throttle 6
  boost 7.5

return stiffness = 34
held damping ratio = 1.04
return damping ratio = 1.30
```

Per component:

```text
damping = 2 * dampingRatio * sqrt(stiffness)
acceleration =
  activeDrive
  - stiffness * distance
  - damping * velocity

velocity += acceleration * dt
distance += velocity * dt
distance = clamp(distance, 0, maxDistance)
```

If clamping blocks velocity in the same direction, zero it. Apply total lag
along negative ship forward after reading the chase mount’s world pose.

This gives acceleration weight without adding camera rotation lag.

## planet-space implementation side and orbit camera

Scale-aware offsets after the ship model loads:

```text
side = (
  shipLength * 3.2,
  shipLength * 1.0,
  -shipLength * 1.35
)

orbit = (
  shipLength * 4.85,
  shipLength * 1.35,
  -shipLength * 2.15
)
```

The camera uses the dominant-body radial vector as up:

```text
bodyUp = normalize(shipPosition - bodyPosition)
```

For orbit lock, forward comes from relative velocity; otherwise it comes from
ship orientation. Project forward onto the body tangent plane:

```text
tangent = forward - bodyUp * dot(forward, bodyUp)
```

Frame-rate-independent smoothing:

```text
side forward response = 1 - exp(-6.5 * dt)
offset response = 1 - exp(-3.6 * dt)
mode blend lambda = 3.2
```

Rebuild an orthonormal frame:

```text
right = normalize(cross(bodyUp, tangent))
tangent = normalize(cross(right, bodyUp))
offset =
  right * offset.x
  + bodyUp * offset.y
  + tangent * offset.z
```

Yaw rotates the offset around `bodyUp`. Pitch rotates around
`cross(bodyUp, offset)`. Pointer input scales:

```text
yaw -= mouseDeltaX * 0.0022
pitch -= mouseDeltaY * 0.0018
```

Expected on screen: mouse-right orbits the view right, mouse-up tilts it up —
verify both axes against the screen-direction contract before retuning the scales.

Pitch bounds vary by flight mode. The implementation also enforces camera height above
the ship:

```text
landed minimum = shipLength * 0.42
other side-camera minimum = shipLength * 0.20
```

If tangent becomes nearly parallel to up (`abs(dot) > 0.985`), rebuild it from
`cross(bodyUp, worldUp)` and then X as a final fallback.

Look target:

```text
target = bodyUp * shipLength * 0.12
quaternion = lookAt(cameraPosition, target, bodyUp)
```

This camera is positioned in ship-root-local coordinates. Preserve that
coordinate ownership when adapting the rig.

## Explicit camera handoffs

planet-space implementation captures position and quaternion at transition start. Launch handoff
begins at progress `0.68`; orbit-exit duration varies from `1.1` to `2.6`
seconds based on the current side-camera blend.

Ease:

```text
eased = 1 - (1 - t)^1.8
position = lerp(startPosition, chasePosition, eased)
orientation = slerp(startQuaternion, chaseQuaternion, eased)
```

Critical transition invariant:

```text
explicit transition active
  -> write camera directly from one lerp/slerp
  -> return from camera update
```

Do not apply the normal follow smoother after this interpolation. Stacked
smoothing causes a mid-transition half-halt.

Outside explicit transitions, the final chase/side pose is followed with:

```text
lambda 9.5 while side blend is active/transitioning
lambda 18 when pure chase
```

At effectively zero blend, copy the chase pose exactly to prevent a permanent
subpixel tail.

## cinematic implementation shot ownership

Each cinematic implementation scene owns its shot and projection values, for example:

```text
Saturn approach:
  FOV 40
  near 12
  far 360000

spin docking:
  FOV 46
  near 35
  far 90000
```

Scenes save prior FOV/near/far, update the projection, and restore all three on
dispose.

The spin-docking shot uses authored world anchors:

```text
camera position = (6878.606, 4914.173, 6141.678)
look target = (6301.714, 4779.175, 5336.091)
```

Ships are then staged in the camera frame:

```text
forward = normalize(lookTarget - cameraPosition)
right = normalize(cross(forward, worldUp))
up = normalize(cross(right, forward))

staging center = cameraPosition + forward * 340
```

Subject offsets are expressed in this shot basis. This is more robust than
tuning independent world coordinates after the camera is framed.

The launch shot instead hard-anchors to a rocket-relative orbit target every
frame. It intentionally avoids follow lag against a rapidly accelerating
subject.

## Pointer-look and movement constraints

`PointerLookControls` uses Euler order `YXZ`, clamps pitch to
`±(π/2 - 0.01)`, and re-syncs yaw/pitch from the current camera quaternion
whenever pointer lock is acquired.

Movement:

```text
forward = camera world direction
right = normalize(cross(forward, worldUp))
distance = movementSpeed * dt
```

Default speed is `9`, sensitivity `0.0023`.

Expected on screen: mouse-right turns the view right, mouse-up looks up — assert
both axes (yaw-only evidence has let inverted pitch ship).

Keys are cleared on:

- pointer-lock exit;
- window blur;
- any update while unlocked.

Scene-specific constraints then run after controls:

- an interior room scene clamps X/Y/Z with floor, ceiling, and wall clearance.
- a terrain scene clamps camera Y above sampled terrain plus `0.2`.
- cinematic scenes block movement keys while retaining their authored camera.

Input control and spatial constraint are separate layers.

## Verified screen-direction bases

Copy these pairs whole — the sign and the basis are only correct TOGETHER. Each
was derived from `screenRight = cross(cameraForward, worldUp)` and verified
against the on-screen result; if you change one half, re-verify with the
input-direction check instead of reasoning about it.

**Chase-cam steering** (vehicle/character heading, camera behind):

```text
heading  = (sin yaw, 0, cos yaw)          // matches rotation.y for a +Z-front model
yaw     -= steer * rate * dt              // steer: D/right = +1, A/left = -1
position += heading * speed * dt
camera at position - heading * dist, lookAt(position)
```

Why the minus: the camera looks along `heading`, so screen-right is
`cross(heading, up) = (-cos yaw, 0, sin yaw)`, while `d(heading)/d(yaw) =
(cos yaw, 0, -sin yaw)` — exactly screen-LEFT. Increasing yaw always veers the
nose left on screen, so "D turns right" needs `yaw -=`. (Equivalently
`yaw += steer` is correct only with heading `(-sin yaw, 0, cos yaw)` — a pair,
never a lone sign.)

**RTS / overhead pan camera** (fixed pitch, yaw-orbiting):

```text
right         = (-cos yaw, 0, sin yaw)    // pitch-independent screen-right on the ground
forwardGround = (sin yaw, 0, cos yaw)     // into the screen along the ground
D / ArrowRight: target += right * pan     A / ArrowLeft: target -= right * pan
W / ArrowUp:    target += forwardGround * pan     S: target -= forwardGround * pan
```

Drag-pan, grab-the-world (terrain follows the pointer; both axes, one
convention — `movementY` is positive DOWNWARD):

```text
target -= right * movementX * k
target += forwardGround * movementY * k
```

Move-the-camera convention = flip BOTH signs, never one. The classic shipped bug
writes `right = (cos yaw, 0, -sin yaw)` — that is `cross(up, forward)`, the LEFT
vector — inverting A/D and the horizontal drag while W/S stay correct.

**Pointer-look** (locked mouse driving yaw/pitch, Euler order `YXZ`):

```text
yaw   -= movementX * sensitivity          // mouse-right -> view turns RIGHT
pitch -= movementY * sensitivity          // mouse-up    -> view tilts UP
```

Expected on screen, both axes, before any tuning: a straight-ahead landmark
slides LEFT when the mouse moves right (the view pans right) and slides DOWN
when the mouse moves up (the view tilts up).

## Floating origin and background handling

The Saturn scene first computes a virtual camera pose, stores its orientation
basis, then:

```text
camera position = origin
Saturn group position = -virtualCameraPosition
atmosphere center uniform = Saturn group position
stars position = camera position
```

The ship flyby is animated in the stored camera basis. This preserves the
authored composition while avoiding enormous camera coordinates.

Stars are tethered to the camera in multiple scenes to remove deep-space
parallax and prevent them from crossing the far envelope.

## Projection and lifecycle ownership

planet-space implementation’s global camera uses:

```text
FOV 38
near 0.2
far 3.0e7
```

**Do not copy those numbers into an ordinary game.** That range only works
because a planet renderer pairs it with `WebGLRenderer({ logarithmicDepthBuffer:
true })`; on a stock 24-bit depth buffer it throws the precision away and any two
surfaces that touch will fight and flicker. The expensive knob is `near`, not
`far`: resolvable depth at distance z is roughly `z² / (near × 2^24)`, so every
halving of `near` halves precision at every distance. Set `near` to the closest
the camera can genuinely get — for a third-person or top-down game that is
metres, not centimetres — and `far` to the far edge of the world, and the ratio
takes care of itself. `genex preview` warns when a camera's range is past what a
plain depth buffer can serve.

It prewarms pipelines by temporarily aiming at representative bodies, then
restores both position and quaternion in `finally`.

cinematic implementation’s scene manager:

```text
dispose active scene
clear scene-root children
create next scene
await init
```

Every scene that changes projection or background restores it on disposal.
This ownership prevents one shot’s lens from leaking into another.

## Failure modes and diagnostics

Observed boundaries:

- planet-space implementation’s scalar spring is semi-implicit Euler; clamp `dt` during long frame
  stalls.
- The chase mount’s final 180-degree correction depends on model conventions.
- Side-camera local/world ownership is easy to break when adapting the ship
  hierarchy.
- Authored cinematic world coordinates are scene-specific; preserve the
  camera-frame staging method, not literal positions.
- Hard camera anchoring is correct for launch composition but unsuitable when
  inertial camera feel is the goal.
- Global-Y pointer movement is not valid for walking on a spherical planet.
