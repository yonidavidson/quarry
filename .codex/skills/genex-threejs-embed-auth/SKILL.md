description: Wire up player identity AND durable game state for a Genex game via @genex-ai/embed-sdk. Load this UNCONDITIONALLY for every game, multiplayer or not, BEFORE writing any boot code — every player gets an identity (signed-in account or guest); per-player saves, shared world state, and leaderboards are one-line SDK calls; multiplayer requires the SDK's token either way.

# Genex Three.js Embed Auth

`@genex-ai/embed-sdk` is how a Genex game learns **who is playing it** — and
how it **saves**. Every game needs it. Published games are playable by
**guests** (no account — the SDK mints a temporary identity like `Guest-1234`
automatically), while **signing in** unlocks saving/loading progress (each
player gets their own save slot) and leaderboard entries; multiplayer works
for both, using the SDK's token. The SDK handles every context with one
`initEmbed(...)` call:

- **Embedded in the Genex dashboard (an iframe):** a silent handshake signs
  the viewer in within a couple of seconds — or drops a signed-out viewer
  straight into guest play. No login screen either way.
- **Standalone (someone opens the game's link directly):** the visit bounces
  once through Genex (at the CDN edge in production, so the game only loads
  AFTER identity is resolved; the SDK does the same bounce itself in local
  dev) — signed-in visitors arrive already authenticated on ANY game with
  zero clicks; everyone else arrives as a guest with a small dismissible
  "sign in to save progress" popover (rendered by the SDK — don't build your
  own). Nobody ever hits a login wall on a published game.
- **Local test mode (your own self-testing):** `?genex_local_test=1` on the
  local dev server boots a credential-less local session — see "Self-testing
  a draft" below.

While identity is resolving (or blocked) the SDK shows its own full-screen
overlay over the game, so never build a separate "connecting" screen for auth.
Guest sessions have **no** overlay — the game just plays.

## Install

```bash
npm i @genex-ai/embed-sdk
```

(Already installed if you followed Step 3 of the scaffold; repeated here so
this skill is self-contained.)

## Bootstrap (required, every game)

```ts
// main.ts — the FIRST thing in the boot sequence, before any other game code
import { initEmbed } from "@genex-ai/embed-sdk";
import { GENEX } from "./genex.config";

initEmbed({
  slug: GENEX.slug,
  apiUrl: GENEX.apiUrl,
  dashboardOrigins: GENEX.dashboardOrigins,
});
```

Also give `<body>` a dark background in `index.html` (e.g.
`<body style="margin:0;background:#080a14">`) — it makes the pre-boot frame
(before any JS runs) match the SDK's own loading overlay instead of flashing
white, and every Genex surface assumes a dark canvas anyway.

Scene setup and asset loading may continue immediately after this call — auth
never blocks rendering. There are **two gates**, and picking the right one
matters:

```ts
import { waitForPlayer, waitForAuth, getColyseusAuth, getEmbedToken } from "@genex-ai/embed-sdk";

// PLAYER gate — resolves for guests AND signed-in players. Use for
// multiplayer connect() and player-name UI. This is the gate almost
// everything wants.
const { user, guest } = await waitForPlayer();
// user.id / user.name — real account identity, or guest:<id> / "Guest-1234"
// user.avatarUrl — the player's OWN VRM avatar (profile pick; per-session for
// guests). It is the FALLBACK body, not the game's character: pass it to
// loadPlayerCharacter({ avatarUrl: user.avatarUrl }) and it is used only when
// this game has no generated character of its own, with the baked
// ./assets/avatar.vrm behind it (absent on old APIs / local test mode).
// Peers resolve the same way via the multiplayer SDK's player.avatarUrl.

// ACCOUNT gate — resolves ONLY for signed-in players (stays pending for
// guests; resolves later if they sign in mid-game). Use ONLY for /state
// saving/loading and other account-bound features.
const { user: account } = await waitForAuth();
```

**NEVER gate scene boot or `connect()` on `waitForAuth()`** — for a guest it
stays pending forever and your game would sit empty. `waitForPlayer()` is the
boot-path gate; `waitForAuth()` guards saves only.

## API surface (exact — do not invent methods)

- `initEmbed({ slug, apiUrl, dashboardOrigins })` — call once, first. All three
  fields required (from `genex.config.ts`).
- `waitForPlayer()` → `Promise<{ user, guest }>` — THE gate for `connect()`
  and player-name UI; resolves for guests and accounts alike, rejects only if
  the session ends up blocked.
- `waitForAuth()` → `Promise<{ user }>` — the gate for `/state` calls and
  account-bound features. Stays PENDING for guests (resolves live if they
  sign in); rejects if blocked. Catch rejections and let the SDK's overlay
  handle the UX (don't build your own sign-in UI).
- `isEmbedded()` → `boolean` — structural "is in an iframe" check; NOT the same
  question as "is signed in".
- `getAuthState()` → `"pending" | "authenticated" | "guest" | "blocked"` —
  synchronous.
- `getUser()` → `{ id, name, image? } | null` — non-null once authenticated OR
  guest. Guest ids are prefixed `guest:` (local test mode: `local:test`).
- `getEmbedToken()` → `string | undefined` — the raw token, for the RARE
  advanced case of calling the Genex API by hand. The state/leaderboard
  helpers below attach it automatically — prefer them; never hand-roll fetch
  calls to `/state` endpoints.
- `getColyseusAuth()` → `{ embedToken } | undefined` — relay credential
  (REQUIRED; guest tokens are accepted). Pass `auth: () => getColyseusAuth()`
  to both `connect()` and `matchmake()` so each explicit connect and every
  automatic re-seat reads a fresh token. Tokens rotate automatically (~every
  10 minutes). Never cache the value across joins and never log it.
- `on(event, cb)` → unsubscribe fn. Events: `"authenticated"`, `"guest"`,
  `"blocked"`, `"error"`. A mid-game sign-in fires `"authenticated"` after
  `"guest"` — progress saving can start right then, no reload.

Durable state + leaderboards (all six are safe to call from boot — they wait
for identity internally, never throw for guests, and reject only when the
session is blocked):

- `loadPlayerState()` → `Promise<{ data, version, guest? }>` — THIS player's
  own save (per-player, per-game; other players can never read or overwrite
  it). `{ data: null, version: 0 }` when they never saved.
- `savePlayerState(data, { ifVersion? }?)` → `Promise<{ saved, version?,
  conflict?, guest?, queued? }>` — save any JSON ≤ 256KB to their slot. For
  guests the value is QUEUED in memory and auto-flushed if they sign in
  mid-game — no extra code. Small saves survive tab close automatically.
- `loadWorldState()` / `saveWorldState(data, { ifVersion? }?)` — the game's
  ONE shared world slot (≤ 1MB, every player reads/writes the same blob) —
  level layouts, persistent-world object positions. Multiplayer games: only
  the host writes it (see the multiplayer skill). Always pass `ifVersion`
  here (shared slot = real races); a losing write resolves
  `{ conflict: true, version }` — reload, merge, retry.
- `submitScore(score, { board?, mode? }?)` → `Promise<{ submitted, best?,
  improved?, guest?, queued? }>` — keep-best leaderboard submit (`mode:
  "min"` for lap-time boards). Guests: best value queues, flushes on sign-in.
- `getLeaderboard({ board?, limit?, order? }?)` → `Promise<{ items, me }>` —
  top entries (verified display names — never trust client-side name input
  for this) + the signed-in player's own `{ rank, score }`. Works for guests
  too (`me: null`). `limit` caps at 100 server-side. Local test mode resolves
  `{ items: [], me: null }` locally.

Server write limits (per player, per minute): **60 player-saves, 120
world-saves, 30 score submits**. A debounced ~1/sec checkpoint never gets near
them — only a save-per-frame loop does (it surfaces as HTTP 429).

## Saving progress (per-player — every player has their own slot)

Use the SDK helpers; never hand-roll fetch calls to the state API. Progression,
inventory, unlocks — anything about ONE player — goes in their player slot:

```ts
import { loadPlayerState, savePlayerState } from "@genex-ai/embed-sdk";

// boot: load whatever this player saved last time (fine for guests — resolves
// { data: null, guest: true } instead of failing)
const { data } = await loadPlayerState();
applyProgress(data ?? defaultProgress());

// checkpoints / level-ups: fire-and-forget, DEBOUNCED (not per frame)
void savePlayerState(progress);
```

Guests need zero special handling: their saves queue in memory and auto-flush
the moment they sign in mid-game (so a guest's progress follows them into
their new account), and `waitForAuth()` resolving is the signal that a real
account now exists. The SDK already tells guests to sign in (its popover / the
dashboard's card) — don't add another prompt.

**Per-player vs world:** `savePlayerState` is each player's own progress;
`saveWorldState` is the game's ONE shared world (persistent-world layouts —
see the multiplayer skill's persistence section for the host-writes pattern).
Never store per-player progression in the world slot: every player of the
game shares that single blob.

## Leaderboards

```ts
import { submitScore, getLeaderboard } from "@genex-ai/embed-sdk";

// on game over / lap complete — keep-best, so just submit every run
void submitScore(finalScore);                            // higher is better
void submitScore(lapMs, { board: "laps", mode: "min" }); // lower is better

// render a top-10 + the player's own rank
const { items, me } = await getLeaderboard({ limit: 10 });
```

Scores are per-account (one row per player per board, real display names from
their Genex account) and keep-best — submitting a worse score changes nothing
(`improved: false`). Guests can READ leaderboards; their submits queue and
post when they sign in. Send a consistent `mode` per board. Scores are
client-reported (arcade-style trust) — don't present them as anti-cheat.

## NEVER log the tokens

**NEVER log the return value of `getEmbedToken()` or `getColyseusAuth()` — not
to `console.log`, not to a crash-reporter or analytics breadcrumb.** The token
is bounded (15 minutes, one game, one scope), but third-party logging-service
retention can outlive that. Nothing in normal game code ever needs to print it.

## Config wiring (already done — do NOT hand-write URLs)

**`genex init` already wrote the config files** — do not create or edit them,
and NEVER hardcode an environment URL anywhere in game code:

- `src/genex.config.ts` — a static env-reader (production URL defaults,
  overridable via `VITE_GENEX_*` env vars). Import `GENEX` from it as shown
  above; treat the file as read-only.
- `.env` — `VITE_GENEX_SLUG` (the game's identity; committed).
- `.env.development.local` — present only when init ran against a local/dev
  stack: URL overrides that apply in `npm run dev` ONLY. A production build
  (`vite build`) always uses the production defaults, so localhost values can
  never ship. Gitignored via `*.local` — never commit it.

If `src/genex.config.ts` is somehow missing (e.g. it was deleted), re-run
`genex init` in the project folder rather than writing one by hand.

## Standalone behavior (what to expect, not something to code)

Opening a published game's link directly (not from the dashboard) shows a
brief "Loading…" overlay while the SDK round-trips through Genex once, then
the game starts: already-signed-in visitors come back authenticated (zero
clicks — on every game), everyone else comes back playing as a guest with the
SDK's own top-right "sign in to save progress" popover. The return trip
carries a one-time pass (or an inert guest marker) in the URL that the SDK
consumes and removes immediately. Unpublished drafts are the exception:
strangers can't play them, so a draft link shows the SDK's sign-in gate
instead (for self-testing, see local test mode below). Don't code around any
of this: no `?`/`#` URL params of yours will be affected, and `isEmbedded()`
/ the return-trip handling are internal SDK concerns.

### Self-testing a draft: local test mode

An unpublished draft shows the sign-in gate to any browser that isn't signed
in as the owner — **including your own test browser** (Playwright, headless
Chrome) — and the hosted draft URL applies the same identity rule. The one
supported way to see and play the game yourself is **local test mode**: open
the local dev server with the explicit opt-in marker —

```
http://localhost:5173/?genex_local_test=1
```

(any port; append with `&` if the URL already has a query). On an exact http
loopback origin (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`) the SDK skips the
identity flow entirely and boots a guest-like session: no redirect, no
overlay, `waitForPlayer()` resolves with the unmistakable local identity
`{ id: "local:test", name: "Local Tester" }`, and the console prints a
"local test mode" notice. Requires `@genex-ai/embed-sdk` 0.5.0+ — on an older
project the marker does nothing; apply the pending platform update first (any
`genex` command prints the update nudge and how to apply it), then retry.

**It validates:** rendering, camera, controls, HUD, game feel, and real
gameplay screenshots — everything local.

**It does NOT validate** (nothing online exists in this mode; no credential
is ever minted): real sign-in (`waitForAuth()` stays pending, exactly like a
guest), saves (they queue in memory), leaderboards (`getLeaderboard()`
resolves `{ items: [], me: null }` locally), score submits, and multiplayer
(`getColyseusAuth()` is `undefined`, so `connect()` fails at the relay —
expected in this mode, not a bug to chase).

Rules:

- **Label the evidence** in your handoff: "validated in local test mode —
  auth, saves, and multiplayer not exercised." Presenting a local-test
  capture as full validation is an over-claim.
- Pointer lock still can't be acquired headlessly (`requestPointerLock`
  throws in headless Chromium): for aim games validate the unlocked "click
  to aim" cue and the wiring, not the lock itself (see
  `$genex-threejs-visual-validation` step 6).
- The marker is inert on any hosted URL, on https, and inside any iframe —
  local test mode cannot open the hosted draft; hosted draft access stays
  owner-only. Do NOT work around that gate: no undocumented URL fragments,
  no auth mocks, and never drive the user's own signed-in browser.
- Opening localhost WITHOUT the marker keeps the normal real-auth flow (the
  identity bounce) — that's for testing real sign-in, not for self-testing.
- The owner's draft run-through stays a required beat, not a fallback: push
  `genex preview` at each playable milestone and hand it off plainly ("check
  the draft — you can now X; ping me if something feels off"), then keep
  building while they look. Hosted QA catches what local test mode can't:
  real identity, saves, multiplayer, feel. Once the game is **published**,
  any fresh browser gets in as a guest, so full visual validation also works
  without the marker.

## Checklist

- [ ] `initEmbed(...)` is the very first call in `main.ts`, with all three
      config fields.
- [ ] `genex.config.ts` includes `dashboardOrigins` (from `.genex/project.json`).
- [ ] Multiplayer and player-name UI await `waitForPlayer()` — NEVER
      `waitForAuth()` (guests would hang forever). Both `connect()` and
      `matchmake()` receive `auth: () => getColyseusAuth()`.
- [ ] Saves/loads use the SDK helpers (`savePlayerState`/`loadPlayerState` for
      per-player progress, `saveWorldState`/`loadWorldState` for the shared
      world, `submitScore`/`getLeaderboard` for scores) — no hand-rolled fetch
      to `/state` endpoints, no manual guest gating (the helpers own it).
- [ ] Per-player progression lives in the PLAYER slot, never in the shared
      world slot.
- [ ] Saves are debounced (checkpoints/level-ups), not per-frame.
- [ ] No token value is ever logged or sent to analytics.
- [ ] No custom sign-in prompt, guest badge, or auth overlay — the SDK popover/
      overlay and the dashboard own all of that UX.
- [ ] Self-test evidence captured in local test mode is labeled as such in the
      handoff ("local test mode — auth, saves, and multiplayer not exercised").

## Troubleshooting

- **Game loads then immediately navigates away (standalone/local dev)** — the
  identity bounce, working as designed for EVERY standalone visit. It returns
  to the game automatically (signed-in or as a guest) within a second.
- **`waitForAuth()` never resolves** — the player is a GUEST; that's the
  designed behavior. Anything that must run for guests belongs behind
  `waitForPlayer()` instead.
- **State is `"blocked"` / `waitForPlayer()` rejects** — an unpublished draft
  opened by a non-owner, or auth infrastructure was unreachable. The SDK
  overlay (or the dashboard, when embedded) shows the sign-in prompt; the game
  just stays paused behind it. Don't retry in a loop. Self-testing a draft
  locally? Use local test mode (`?genex_local_test=1`) instead.
- **Local test mode doesn't activate** — check all four: the value is exactly
  `genex_local_test=1`, the origin is http loopback (`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/
  `[::1]` — not https, not a LAN IP), the page is not inside an iframe, and
  `@genex-ai/embed-sdk` is 0.5.0+ (older: apply the pending platform update).
- **Multiplayer `connect()` fails in local test mode** — by design: no relay
  credential exists there. Validate multiplayer on the hosted draft (the
  owner's session) or the published game, and say plainly when it wasn't.
- **Multiplayer join rejected with 401** — the join ran before
  `waitForPlayer()` resolved, without `auth: () => getColyseusAuth()`, or with a
  stale cached token on reconnect (read it fresh each call).
- **Multiplayer join rejected with 403 "guest capacity"** — the room is at its
  guest limit; only signing in gets the player a seat right now. Surface the
  relay's message as-is.
- **`/state` returns 401/403 (hand-rolled fetch)** — missing `Authorization`
  header (401), a guest token (403 `guest_no_save`), or the token belongs to a
  different game (403). All three mean the code bypassed the SDK helpers —
  switch to `savePlayerState`/`saveWorldState`, which handle every case.
- **Saves or score submits return 429** — writing too often (per-player limits:
  60 player-saves/min, 120 world-saves/min, 30 score submits/min). Debounce to
  ~1 write/sec at checkpoints and never save in the render loop; back off a
  second and retry.
- **`saveWorldState` resolves `{ conflict: true }`** — another player wrote the
  shared slot since your last read. Expected under concurrency: reload with
  `loadWorldState()`, merge, retry with the fresh `version`. If it happens
  constantly, more than one client is acting as the writer — in multiplayer,
  only the host should save the world.
