description: Apply Genex platform updates safely. Use when a genex command prints an update nudge ("⬆ Genex … available — run: …"), a skills-refresh line ("🔄 Genex skills updated"), or an update-required refusal (HTTP 426, cli_update_required), or when the user asks about updating Genex packages.

# Genex Updates — apply platform updates at safe moments

Genex ships improvements continuously. The `genex` CLI tells you when something
is stale; you (the agent) apply the update at the right moment and tell the
user what happened. The user never manages versions themselves.

## The signals in `genex` output

| Line | Meaning | What you do |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `🔄 Genex skills updated to X.Y.Z` | Skills were auto-refreshed to match the installed CLI. | Nothing — informational. Skills stay in sync on their own. |
| `⬆ Genex <package> X.Y.Z available (installed A.B.C) — run: <command>` | A newer npm package exists. | Run the printed command at a **safe moment** (below), then tell the user. |
| `✗ … below the minimum supported version … Update now — run: <command>` | The API refuses this CLI version (HTTP 426, `cli_update_required`). | Run the printed command **now**, then re-run the refused genex command. |
| `✗ Out of credits — … costs N credits; your balance is M.` | The account can't cover this generation (HTTP 402, `insufficient_credits`). | Relay the printed facts (balance, cost, refill date, link) to the user; offer a procedural placeholder so the build continues — see the generation skill's Troubleshooting. |
| `✗ Email not verified — …` | Generation credits are locked until the email is verified (HTTP 403, `email_verification_required`). | Give the user the printed verify link, wait for them to confirm, then re-run the command. |

## Safe moments — when to apply a nudge

Update when nothing is in flight:

- at the start of a session, before you begin the user's task;
- between tasks, after the current change is finished and working;
- right before a `genex preview`/`publish` you have **not** started yet.

Never mid-task: not during a build or deploy, not halfway through a code
change, not while the user is waiting for something else. A nudge is a
suggestion — if now is not a safe moment, finish first; the nudge reappears on
the next command. (The 426 refusal is the exception: nothing works until you
update, so update immediately.)

## How to apply

Run exactly the command the nudge printed, from the game project root:

```bash
npm i -D @genex-ai/cli-demo@latest   # the genex CLI (a dev dependency)
npm i @genex-ai/embed-sdk@latest     # identity/saves SDK (ships inside the game)
npm i @genex-ai/multiplayer@latest   # multiplayer SDK (only if the game uses it)
```

Skills refresh automatically on the next `genex` command after a CLI update —
no extra step. Then tell the user in one short line what changed and why it
matters, e.g. "I also updated Genex to 0.22 — skills and SDK refreshed." For
what's new, check the package page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@genex-ai/cli-demo

## Hard rules

- **Never touch game code as part of an update.** Everything in the game's
  `src/` — including vendored controller code in `src/controllers/` — is
  user-owned and may carry customizations. Updates never overwrite it. If a
  newer controller exists you may *mention* that `genex controller <type>
  --force` re-vendors it, but run that only when the user explicitly opts in
  (it overwrites their changes).
- **Never update silently.** `npm i …@latest` changes `package.json` — that is
  the sanctioned path, but always say in chat that you did it.
- **Never downgrade**, and never pin to an old version to "fix" an error —
  report the error instead.
- **Never switch the CLI's channel.** A project built from the dev stand
  (`dev.genex.games` — check `dashboardOrigins` in `.genex/project.json`)
  runs `@genex-ai/cli-demo@dev`; installing `@latest` there is a downgrade to
  the production build — it swaps the installed skills and re-points every
  command at the wrong stand. Run exactly what the nudge printed (it is
  channel-aware; on the dev channel it never offers a CLI update at all).
- **Verify after updating**: the game should still build/run. If it does not,
  say exactly what broke rather than quietly reverting.
- If `npm i` fails (offline, registry down), say so and continue on the
  current version — everything keeps working, and the nudge will reappear.
- A published game is never affected by any of this: its live bundle is frozen
  and keeps working regardless of local package versions.
