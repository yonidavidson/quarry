description: Generate a real 3D model (GLB mesh) from a text prompt with `npx genex model`, then load it into the Three.js scene. Use when the user wants a specific prop, item, character, vehicle, building, or any concrete object as an actual mesh ("add a wooden barrel", "I need a spaceship", "generate a sword") rather than a procedurally-coded shape.

# Genex AI · Model

Turn a text prompt into a real, game-ready **GLB** and drop it into the project.

## When to use this vs. procedural geometry

- **Use `npx genex model`** for a specific, recognizable object — a barrel, a chair, a
  sword, a spaceship, an animal. You get a real textured mesh.
- **Use `$genex-threejs-procedural-geometry`** for parametric/abstract shapes,
  terrain, or anything you want to generate in code (infinite variations, no files).

**The output is a STATIC, unrigged mesh — no skeleton, no animation clips.**
A "wolf" or "guard" from this command can be posed and moved as one object,
but its limbs cannot animate. Anything that must walk, attack, or die on
screen routes to the creature lane instead: `npx genex creature` for
biped-shaped bodies (real rig + library clips), or this command plus the
procedural-motion recipes for everything else — `$genex-threejs-creatures`
owns that split. The player's own character is `$genex-ai-character`.

## Run

```bash
npx genex model "<prompt>"
```

Write a specific prompt — "weathered wooden barrel with rusted iron bands" beats
"barrel". The command blocks until the mesh is ready (up to ~a minute), then prints
its public URL:

```
https://assets.genex.technology/generations/<id>/model-glb
```

The GLB lives in Genex storage (R2) and loads straight from that URL. You **don't
download it** and **nothing is committed to your repo** — copy the URL the command
prints into your loader. The URL is permanent, so it works the same in local dev, your
published game, and remixes.

## Models that point somewhere must face forward

Any model with a "front" the game aims — the hero the player controls, an **NPC that
walks toward or looks at players**, a turret, a vehicle — should face **forward**: its
front toward `+Z` (glTF's "looking forward"), so yaw/`lookAt` code points it correctly.
A hero whose nose points sideways — or an enemy that chases you while staring off to the
side — reads as broken at a glance.

- **In the prompt:** ask for it — e.g. `"...game-ready, facing forward, front toward +Z"`.
  Treat this as a hint, not a guarantee: generated meshes regularly come back rotated
  anyway, so the check below is never optional.
- **On load (always check — hero AND NPC):** if the GLB isn't `+Z`-forward, rotate it
  once. Wrap the model in a parent `Object3D` and put the correction on the child, so
  game code rotates the parent cleanly:
  ```ts
  const rig = new THREE.Object3D();
  gltf.scene.rotation.y = Math.PI / 2; // one-time facing correction — tune per model
  rig.add(gltf.scene);
  scene.add(rig); // move/rotate/lookAt `rig`, not gltf.scene
  ```
  Clones inherit the fix only if you clone the corrected child (or the whole rig) —
  never the raw `gltf.scene`.
- **Verify it, don't assume it.** Orientation **is** visible in a still — in your
  self-check screenshot confirm the hero faces its travel direction AND that NPCs driven
  by chase/aim code face their target (an enemy rotated 90° from its victim is this
  pipeline's most common visible bug). On an unpublished draft, capture real gameplay in
  local test mode (`?genex_local_test=1` on the dev server — the embed-auth skill's
  "Self-testing a draft" section); if you still can't capture gameplay, say so plainly
  instead of skipping the check silently.

## Load it into the scene

Load through the quality kit's decoder-wired loader and the model rung ladder
(`$genex-threejs-adaptive-quality`; `npx genex controller quality` installs
it). The bare URL is the provider-raw original — ~500k triangles + several 4K
PBR textures, archival/remix source, NOT a game asset (31 raw props once
floored an M4 Max). Every model ships a game-ready ladder instead: desktop
tiers load the `@2048` rung, phones the `@1024` rung (both meshopt-compressed
and simplified), and KTX2-capable games get the GPU-compressed sibling. R2
sends the right CORS headers, so cross-origin loading just works:

```ts
import { createGltfLoader } from "./controllers/quality/gltf-loader.ts";
import { loadModelWithFallback } from "./controllers/quality/pick-asset.ts";
import { detectTier } from "./controllers/quality/tier.ts";

const tier = detectTier(); // reuse the boot tier if you already have it
const gltfLoader = createGltfLoader(renderer); // once at boot — meshopt + KTX2
// the URL `npx genex model` printed:
const MODEL_URL = "https://assets.genex.technology/generations/<id>/model-glb";
const gltf = await loadModelWithFallback(
  MODEL_URL, tier, (u) => gltfLoader.loader.loadAsync(u), { ktx2: gltfLoader.ktx2 },
);
const model = gltf.scene;
// Tame ONLY the provider's mirror-metal artifact (metalness≈1 + near-zero
// roughness mirrors the whole sky env and swims with every camera move). Do
// NOT flatten every material to 0.6 — that was dulling legitimately metallic
// props (gunmetal, chrome, gold, polished stone). Clamp the extreme case only;
// leave everything else as authored.
model.traverse((o) => {
  const m = (o as THREE.Mesh).material as THREE.MeshStandardMaterial;
  if (!m?.isMeshStandardMaterial) return;
  if (m.metalness > 0.85 && m.roughness < 0.2) {
    m.metalness = 0.7; // still reads metallic, no longer a full mirror
    m.roughness = Math.max(m.roughness, 0.3);
  }
  m.envMapIntensity = Math.min(m.envMapIntensity, 0.8);
});
// If a model that SHOULD read metallic still looks dull, this clamp is not the
// cause — check the model against the concept and lift per-material as needed.
model.scale.setScalar(1); // tune to taste
model.position.set(0, 0, 0);
scene.add(model);
```

A missing rung falls back to the original automatically (each fallback warns —
never silent). Without the quality kit a plain
`new GLTFLoader().loadAsync(MODEL_URL)` still works, but every device pays for
the full original — phones included.

Never swallow a failed load silently: if you wrap a generated-asset load in a
`catch`, `console.warn` the asset name in it — your own self-check reads the
console, and a bare `.catch(() => null)` hides a missing model from you too.

**Copies**: one or two, `model.clone()` (clones share geometry/textures on the
GPU). **Three or more of the same model → `InstancedMesh`** — clones still cost
one draw call per mesh per copy; instancing renders all copies in one draw
call per source mesh:

```ts
// placements: THREE.Matrix4[] — one world transform per copy
const group = new THREE.Group();
gltf.scene.updateMatrixWorld(true);
const tmp = new THREE.Matrix4();
gltf.scene.traverse((o) => {
  const src = o as THREE.Mesh;
  if (!src.isMesh) return;
  const im = new THREE.InstancedMesh(src.geometry, src.material, placements.length);
  placements.forEach((p, i) => im.setMatrixAt(i, tmp.multiplyMatrices(p, src.matrixWorld)));
  im.instanceMatrix.needsUpdate = true;
  im.castShadow = im.receiveShadow = true;
  group.add(im);
});
scene.add(group);
```

**Distance LOD** (open worlds / long sightlines): the rung ladder already ships
a lighter mesh — use the phone rung as the far level. One extra fetch; worth it
past ~25 m draw ranges, skip it in small arenas:

```ts
const far = await gltfLoader.loader.loadAsync(`${MODEL_URL}@1024`);
const lod = new THREE.LOD();
lod.addLevel(gltf.scene, 0);   // near: the tier's rung
lod.addLevel(far.scene, 25);   // far: phone rung — three swaps by camera distance
scene.add(lod);
```

For animated GLBs, drive `gltf.animations` with a `THREE.AnimationMixer`
(animated/skinned meshes can't instance — clone those).

**If the game has physics, give the model a collider** — a GLB added only to the
scene is a ghost: players and objects pass straight through it.
`$genex-threejs-physics-rapier` has the decision table
(`collidersFromObject(model, "hull")` is the default for props).

## Publish checklist (so players see the model)

- Load it from the **URL** the command printed — it's absolute and permanent, so it
  resolves the same in local dev, the published game, and remixes. Nothing to commit.
- Don't copy the GLB into `public/assets/` — generated assets live in R2, not the repo.

## Options

- `--no-wait` — enqueue and return immediately (won't print the URL; re-run without
  `--no-wait` to get it).
- `--api-url <url>` — override the API base (local dev).

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not authorized"** — run `npx genex init` first (in the project — it resolves this project's own CLI) (it writes your `GENEX_TOKEN`).
- **"Out of credits" (`insufficient_credits`)** — the account has no credits left for
  this model generation. Tell the user the facts the CLI printed: their balance, this
  generation's cost, and when their credits refill. Then offer to continue the build
  with a procedurally-coded placeholder (a simple Three.js primitive-based stand-in
  mesh) and mark the spot with `// TODO(genex): regenerate when credits refill` so
  the real asset is one command away later. Do not stop the session over this.
- **"Email not verified" (`email_verification_required`)** — generation credits
  unlock after the account's email is verified. Give the user the verify link the
  CLI printed, wait for them to confirm, then re-run the command.
- **The mesh looks low-detail / wrong** — make the prompt more specific
  (materials, style, parts) and regenerate; each run is a fresh asset.
